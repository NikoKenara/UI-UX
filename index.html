				<h3>The Challenge</h3>

			<div class="content-challenge">
				<p>
				Redesigned an app had some of it's challenged for me personally, but by having those challenges i could grow myself by knowing what need to be done. The major problem that i have in this project are the app that i tried to redesigned itself, because there's so much to improve yet the due time that i have are slim. So what i did is focusing on what i want to improve.

		<h3>Narrow down the focus</h3>
		<p>The first thing that i notice from the the app is the announce section, for me personally it looks too much distractions for the user to see. So what i did was removing most of the announce section and making it into one horizontal line of section.</p>

		<h3>Customer testimonial Matters</h3>
		<p>
			Looking at another e commerce app, i found that the app doesn't encourage the user to giving testimony, the comment section in the product page aren't transparent. 
			<br><br>
			So what i did to improve the app is to make the comment section visible by the other user and making the old comment section into the feedback feature for the app, because the comment section in the app are more like a feedback section.
		</p>

<!---SLIDE THREE--->
<section class="slide-three">

	<div class="text-3">
		<h3>Redesign, Not Rebuild </h3>
		<p>
			In terms of keeping the characteristics style of the app, i keep the color pallets of this app the same. With only focusing in few colors, the app doesn't looks like too spoiled and making it looks simple and neat.
		</p>
	</div>
</section>

<!---SLIDE FOUR--->
<section class="slide-four">
	<img src="image bank/review-4.png">
	<div class="text-4">
		<h3>Extra attention to details</h3>

		<p>
			One of the flaw that i see in this app was the lack of icons. Other than making the app looks great, giving an icons makes people more familiar using something, most of app these days doesn't even need a description about what's the icon about, people already familiar with it.
